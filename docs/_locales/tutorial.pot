msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:63
msgid "The ``rate.html`` file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:69
msgid "This allows us to implement the block layout. It is a regular HTML file, but it may contain Rapido **elements**, enclosed in brackets. In our case, we have one element, namely ``{like}``, in charge of rendering the *\"Like\"* button."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:73
msgid "The ``rate.py`` file"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:81
msgid "It provides the element's implementation. Each element in the block has a corresponding Python function having the same id. In our case, that is the code that will be executed when a user clicks on *\"Like\"*. Right now, it does nothing, but we will change it later."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:86
msgid "The ``rate.yaml`` file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:95
msgid "This file contains all the needed settings for our block. Here we declare that our block contains one element named ``like``, which is an **action** (i.e. it will be rendered as a button), and its displayed label is *\"Like\"*."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:99
msgid "Now that our block is ready, we can see it using the following URL:"

#: ../tutorial.rst:101
msgid "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/rating/blocks/rate"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:105
msgid "The next step is to embed our block in our Plone pages."

#: ../tutorial.rst:108
msgid "Inserting the block in Plone pages"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:110
msgid "To include our block somewhere in Plone, we will use a Diazo rule. Let's open our ``rules.xml`` file in the root of our theme, and add the following lines:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:120
msgid "The ``include`` directive allows us to retrieve a piece of content; in our case, the HTML form produced by our block. And the ``after`` directive inserts it after the main title in our page."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:124
msgid "So, now if we visit any page of our Plone site, we see our block displayed just under the title."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:129
msgid "That is nice, but there is a small problem: when we click on the *\"Like\"* button, we are redirected to the raw block content, and we lose our current Plone page."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:132
msgid "Let's fix that."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:135
msgid "Staying in our Plone page"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:137
msgid "If we want to stay on our current page after submitting our block, we need to enable **AJAX** mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:140
msgid "To do this, let's change our ``rate.yaml`` file like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:150
msgid "Now, if we click on the *\"Like\"* button, the block is just reloaded dynamically, and we stay in our current page."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:154
msgid "Counting the votes"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:156
msgid "Let's go back to ``rate.py``, and focus on the ``like`` function implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:158
msgid "When a user clicks on the *\"Like\"* button, we need to get the current content the user voted for, check how many votes it already has, and add one new vote."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:161
msgid "Rapido allows to create **records**, so we will create a record for each content item, and we will use the content path as an id."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:164
msgid "So let's replace our current implementation with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:177
msgid "``context.content`` returns the current Plone content, and ``absolute_url_path`` is a Plone method returning the path of a Plone object."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:180
msgid "``context.app`` allows to access to the current Rapido app, so we can easily use the Rapido API, like ``create_record`` or ``get_record``."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:183
msgid "A Rapido record contains **items**. The ``get(item, default=none)`` method returns the value of the requested item or the default value if the item does not exist."

msgid "Displaying the votes"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:190
msgid "Now we are able to store votes, we also want to display the *total* of votes."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:192
msgid "Fist, let's change the block layout in ``rate.html``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:199
msgid "So now we have a new ``display`` element in our block."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:201
msgid "We must declare it in ``rate.yaml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:212
msgid "And let's implement it in ``rate.py``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:223
msgid "We get the record corresponding to the current content, and we return as many ❤ as votes we have stored."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:228
msgid "That's it! Our rating feature is ready to be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:231
msgid "Debugging"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:233
msgid "As we are writing code, we might (we will) make mistakes. In this case, , it is always helpul to read the error messages returned by the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:236
msgid "It is also very helpful to be able to log messages from our code, so we understand what is going on exactly when it is executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:239
msgid "Rapido provides the ``context.app.log()`` method which will log string messages or any serializable object (dictionnaries, arrays, etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:242
msgid "The log messages and the error messages are visible in the server log (but we might not be able to access it), but also in our browser's **javascript console**."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:245
msgid "First thing to do is to enable the **debug mode** in our app. To do that, we need to create a ``settings.yaml`` file in ``/rapido/rating``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:252
msgid "And now, let's change our ``display`` function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:264
msgid "We will see the following in our browser's console:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:268
msgid "Let's imagine now we made an error like forgetting the colon at the end of the ``if`` statement:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:280
msgid "Then we get this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:285
msgid "Listing the top 5 items"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:287
msgid "We would also like to see the top 5 rated content items on the site home page."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:289
msgid "The first thing we need is to index the ``total`` element."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:291
msgid "We declare its indexing mode in ``rate.yaml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:305
msgid "To index the previously stored values, we have to refresh the storage index by calling the following URL:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:308
msgid "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/rating/refresh"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:310
msgid "And to make sure future changes will be indexed, we need to fix the ``like`` function in the ``rate`` block: the indexing is triggered when we call the record's ``save`` method:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:326
msgid "We are now able to build a block to display the top 5 contents:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:328
msgid "``top5.html``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:335
msgid "``top5.yaml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:342
msgid "``top5.py``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:358
msgid "The ``search`` method allows us to query our stored records. The record ids are the content paths, so using the Plone API (``context.api``), we can easily get the corresponding contents, and then obtain their URLs and titles."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:362
msgid "Our block works now:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:364
msgid "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/rating/blocks/top5"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:366
msgid "Finally, we have to insert our block in the home page. That will be done in ``rules.xml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:380
msgid "Creating a new page for reports"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:382
msgid "For now, we have just added small chunks of HTML in existing pages. But Rapido also allows us to create a new page (a Plone developer would name it a new `view`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:385
msgid "Let's pretend we want to create a report page about the votes on the content of a folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:388
msgid "First, we need a block, ``report.html``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:395
msgid "We want this block to be the main content of a new view."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:397
msgid "We need to declare it in a new YAML file called ``report.yaml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:405
msgid "Now if we visit for instance:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:407
msgid "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@show-report"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:409
msgid "we do see our block as main page content."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:411
msgid "Now we need to implement our report content. We could do it with a Rapido element like we did in the Top 5 block."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:414
msgid "Let's change our approach and implement a fancy pie chart using the `amazing D3js library <http://d3js.org/>`_ and the :doc:`Rapido REST API <./rest>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:417
msgid "We need to create a Javascript file (``report.js``) in the ``/rapido/rating`` folder:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:508
msgid "That is quite a complex script, and we will not detail here the D3js-related aspects (it is just a typical example to draw a pie chart); we will focus on the way we obtain the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:512
msgid "The first thing to notice is the ``require`` function. It is a feature of the RequireJS library (provided with Plone by default) to load our dependencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:515
msgid "We have 2 dependencies:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:517
msgid "``mockup-utils``, which is a Plone internal resource,"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:518
msgid "D3js (and we load it by passing its remote URL to RequireJS)."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:520
msgid "``mockup-utils`` allows us to get the authenticator token (with the ``getAuthenticator`` method), we need it to use the Rapido REST API."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:525
msgid "RequireJS or ``mockup-utils`` are not mandatory to use the Rapido REST API, if we were outside of Plone (using Rapido as a remote backend), we would have made a call to ``../@@rapido/rating`` which returns the token in an HTTP header. We just use them because they are provided by Plone by default, and they make our work easier."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:531
msgid "Instead of loading D3 directly form its CDN, we could have put the ``d3.v3.min.js`` in the ``/rapido/rating`` folder, and serve it locally."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:534
msgid "The second interesting part is the ``d3.json()`` call:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:536
msgid "it calls the ``@@rapido/rating/search`` endpoint,"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:537
msgid "it puts the authenticator token in the ``X-Csrf-Token`` header,"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:538
msgid "and it passes the search query in the request BODY."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:540
msgid "That is basically what we need to do whatever JS framework we use (here we use D3, but it could be a generalist framework like Angular, Backbone, Ember, etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:543
msgid "Now we just need to load this script from our block:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:551
msgid "And we can visit:"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:553
msgid "http://localhost:8080/Plone/news/@@show-report"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:555
msgid "to see a pie chart about votes on the *News* items!!"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:559
msgid "Download the :download:`source files of this tutorial <files/tutorial.zip>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:563
msgid "This .zip file can be imported in the theming editor, but it cannot be activated as a regular theme as it just contains our Rapido app. The app can be used from our main theme by adding a `rating.lnk` file in our current theme's ``rapido`` folder, containing::"
msgstr ""

#: ../tutorial.rst:568
msgid "indicating the Rapido app named ``rating`` is stored in the theme named ``tutorial``. And then we can activate our specific rules by adding:"

msgid "in our main theme's ``rules.xml``."
