Displaying Rapido in Plone
==========================

We can see a block by visiting its URL:

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/myapp/blocks/simpleblock

Similarly for a record:

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/myapp/record/my-record-id

But it just returns the HTML generated by the block.

To show our blocks in our Plone site, there are 4 possibilities:

Diazo rules
-----------

We can use the `Diazo <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/>`_ ``include``
directive to get the Rapido block content and inject it in our pages with
``before``, ``after`` or ``replace`` directives.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <before css:content="#content-core">
        <include css:content="form" href="/@@rapido/myapp/blocks/simpleblock" />
    </before>

Extra views
-----------

.. warning:: Since rapido.plone 1.1, we can declare first-class Plone views from Rapido, but it requires plone.resources 1.2.

If we do not want to just inject a small piece of HTML in existing pages,
but use a Rapido block as the main part of the page, we can declare a block as a view in its YAML file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    view:
        id: my-custom-view
        with_theme: true

And then we call ``@@my-custom-view`` on any content, like:

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/news/@@my-custom-view

and it displays our block as main page content.

If the ``with_theme`` property is ``false``, the page is rendered without the Plone theme (we just get the block by itself).

Extra views before 1.1
----------------------

**DEPRECATED since rapido.plone 1.1**

If we do not want to just inject a small piece of HTML in existing pages,
but create a new view for our contents, we can use the Rapido **neutral views**.

Neutral views are obtained by adding ``@@rapido/view/<any-name>`` to a
content URL. It will just return the content's default view (that is why we
call them neutral).

For instance, all those URLs display the same thing::

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/front-page
    http://localhost:8080/Plone/front-page/@@rapido/view/
    http://localhost:8080/Plone/front-page/@@rapido/view/abc
    http://localhost:8080/Plone/front-page/@@rapido/view/123

So we are able to call a content with a URL we control, and that allows us
to create specific Diazo rules for it using the ``if-path`` attribute.

**Hard-coded injection**

.. code-block:: xml
    
    <rules if-path="@@rapido/view/show-report">
        <replace css:content="#content">
            <include css:content="form" href="/@@rapido/stats/blocks/report" />
        </replace>      
    </rules>

In this example, if we open:

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/view/show-report

we will see our page main content replaced with our ``report`` block.

**Dynamic injection**

We can also dynamically display a Rapido resource specified in the URL.
Rapido provides an URL injection pattern which allows to refer to the parent request in our Diazo rule.

The pattern is: ``$<integer>``, where the integer specifies the starting position after ``@@rapido`` to get the path to inject.

For instance:

- with ``http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/view/show-report/5654654``,
  ``$3`` gets the part of the path starting at the 3rd element after
  ``@@rapido``, which is: ``5654654``,
- with
  ``http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/view/show-report/myapp/record/5654654``,
  ``$3`` gets the part of the path starting at the 3rd element after
  ``@@rapido``, which is: ``myapp/record/5654654``,
- with
  ``http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/view/show-report/myapp/record/5654654/edit``,
  ``$5`` gets the part of the path starting at the 5th element after
  ``@@rapido``, which is: ``5654654/edit``.

Examples:

.. code-block:: xml

    <rules if-path="@@rapido/view/show-report">
        <replace css:content="#content-core">
            <include css:content="form" href="/@@rapido/$3" />
        </replace>
    </rules>

if we open:

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/view/show-report/myapp/record/my-record-id

we will render ``myapp/record/my-record-id`` in our page main content.

We could also do:

.. code-block:: xml

    <rules if-path="@@rapido/view/show-report">
        <replace css:content="#content-core">
            <include css:content="form" href="/@@rapido/myapp/record/$3" />
        </replace>
    </rules>

if we open:

    http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@rapido/view/show-report/my-record-id

we will get the very same rendering as in our previous example.

Mosaic
------

`Mosaic <http://plone-app-mosaic.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/>`_
is a layout editor.

It allows to add and manipulate *tiles* in our content layouts.

Rapido provides a Mosaic tile, so any Rapido block can be added as a tile to
our layouts.

To enable it, we need to install Mosaic and then to import a specific Rapido
Generic Setup profile named "rapido.plone mosaic tile".

Mockup patterns
---------------

Some Mockup patterns can display contents provided by an URL.
The two main use cases are:

- **Display a Rapido block in a modal**:
  we use the ``plone-modal`` pattern on a ``<a>`` element,
  the Rapido block URL will be provided in its ``href`` attribute,
  and we just need to specify ``form.rapido-block`` as content selector
  (because ``plone-modal`` default content selector is ``#content``,
  which is accurate for a Plone page but not for a Rapido block). Example:

  We create a block named ``my-content`` containing whatever we might need,
  and we create a block named ``menu`` containing the following HTML:

  .. code-block:: html

        <a href="@@rapido/my-app/blocks/my-content"
            class="plone-btn pat-plone-modal"
            data-pat-plone-modal="content: form.rapido-block">
                Open in a modal
        </a>

  And then we just need to insert ``menu`` in our Plone page (using a Diazo rule).

  See `Mockup modal documentation <http://plone.github.io/mockup/dev/#pattern/modal>`_ for more details about the options.

- **Load a Rapido block dynamically in the current page**:
  we use the ``plone-contentloader`` to inject our Rapido block wherever we want.
  In our previous example, we would change the ``menu`` HTML to:

  .. code-block:: html

        <a href="#" class="pat-contentloader"
           data-pat-contentloader="url:@@rapido/my-app/blocks/my-content#form.rapido-block;">
           Load content</a>

  It would replace the "Load content" link with our ``my-content`` block when we click on the link.

  .. warning:: with ``plone-contentloader``, the content selector is passed directly as an hash at the end of the URL.

  ``plone-contentloader`` also allows us to target a specific element for the injection (instead of replacing the link):

  .. code-block:: html

        <a href="#" class="pat-contentloader"
           data-pat-contentloader="url:@@rapido/my-app/blocks/my-content#form.rapido-block;target:#here;">
           Load content</a>
        <p id="here">Insert my content here.</p>

  By default, the injection is triggered by a click,
  but we can choose any DOM event (``mouseover`` for instance),
  and we can even perform the injection immediately (using the ``immediate`` trigger):

  .. code-block:: html

        <a href="#" class="pat-contentloader"
           data-pat-contentloader="url:@@rapido/my-app/blocks/my-content#form.rapido-block;trigger:immediate">
           Load content</a>
